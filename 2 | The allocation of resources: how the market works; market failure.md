<h1 id="market-failure">Market Failure</h1>
<h2 id="definitions-2">Definitions</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Demerit goods</strong> are goods or services which, when consumed, cause negative spillover effects in an economy (e.g. cigarette smoking, alcohol and gambling). Demerit goods are over-consumed due to imperfect consumer information about such goods.</li>
<li><strong>Merit goods</strong> are goods or services which, when consumed, create positive spillover effects in an economy (e.g. education, training and health care). Merit goods are under-consumed so government intervention is often needed .</li>
<li><strong>Free riders</strong> are people who take advantage of the goods or services provided by the government but have not contributed to government revenue through taxation.</li>
<li><strong>Market failure</strong> occurs when the market forces of demand and supply fail to allocate resources efficiently and cause external costs or external benefits.</li>
<li><strong>Private Benefit/Cost</strong>: benefits/cost the business or consumer receives from producing/consuming the good</li>
<li><strong>External Benefit/Cost</strong>: advantages/disadvantages society receives due to us of a certain good/service</li>
<li><strong>Externalities</strong> (or spill over effects) occur where the actions of firms and individuals have either a positive or negative effect on third parties.
<ul>
<li><strong>External benefits</strong> are the positive side-effects of production or consumption incurred by third parties, for which no money is paid by the beneficiary.</li>
<li><strong>External costs</strong> are the negative side-effects of production or consumption incurred by third parties, for which no compensation is paid.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>A <strong>subsidy</strong> is a sum of money given by the government to a producer to reduce the costs of production or to a consumer to reduce the price of consumption.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="content-2">Content</h2>
<h3 id="social-costs-and-benefits">Social costs and benefits</h3>
<pre><code>* `Social costs = Private costs + External costs`
* `Social benefits = Private benefits + External benefits`
* ` Social costs &gt; Social benefits` =&gt; product is uneconomic
* `Social costs &lt; Social benefits` =&gt; product is economic
</code></pre>
<h3 id="causes-of-market-failure">Causes of market failure</h3>
<ol>
<li>Overproduction and overconsumption of goods or services which cause negative externalities on a third party</li>
<li>Underproduction and underconsumption of goods or services which cause positive externalities on a third party</li>
<li>Failure of the private sector to provide public goods due to lack of a profit motive</li>
<li>The existence of a monopoly that charges high prices and exploits customers</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="government-intervention-to-solve-market-failure">Government intervention to solve market failure</h3>
<ol>
<li>Tax on demerit goods
<ul>
<li>Advantages
<ol>
<li>It increases the price, and therefore decreases the quantity demanded.</li>
<li>Creates tax revenue for government which can be used on other services</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>Disadvantages
<ol>
<li>Demand may be price elastic, so consumption may not be impacted.</li>
<li>Indirect taxation is regressive, and has a greater impact on low-income earners than high-income earners.</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Subsidies for merit goods</li>
<li>Rules and regulations
<ul>
<li>Government bans and legislation can decrease consumption of goods, such as minimum age limits or bans.</li>
<li>Advantages
<ol>
<li>Consumption of the good or service may be reduced.</li>
<li>Awareness of the negative impacts of demerit goods may change long term consumption.</li>
<li>Awareness of the positive impacts of consumption of merit goods is raised.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>Disadvantages
<ol>
<li>Restrictions may cause underground illegal markets to develop</li>
<li>Government has no control over underground markets</li>
<li>People break the rules and commit crimes</li>
<li>The fine or punishment for ignoring the rules is hard to enforce and must be set high</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Advertising and education
<ul>
<li>Advantages
<ol>
<li>Behaviour and consumption patterns of individuals and firms may change</li>
<li>Successful advertising may lead to a positive cultural change in the long term</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>Disadvantages
<ol>
<li>Education and advertising have an opportunity cost for the government</li>
<li>Not all of it is effective</li>
<li>It can take a long time to educate people and for them to accept the message and act on it.</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Government provision of public goods
<ul>
<li>Advantages
<ol>
<li>The goods and services are accessible to all people, regardless of their income or social status.</li>
<li>The consumption of the goods and services has positive externalities as well as private benefits.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>Disadvantages
<ol>
<li>Opportunity cost for government</li>
<li>Free goods and services may be over-consumed, so long queues or shortages</li>
<li>In case of shortage, it is hard to determine who should be able to take advantage of the services</li>
<li>Free riders are able to take advantage of free goods and services without contributing to government revenue by paying taxes.</li>
