    Below are economics notes for each section of the syllabus. They cover all of the relevant points from the textbook under each section, and I hope they're useful study notes to just look at or revise from. Cross-checked with multiple sources. Please reach out to nvishnu@tisb.ac.in for rectifications, love, or existential crises.
